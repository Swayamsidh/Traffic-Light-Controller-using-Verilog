# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Verilog
This code using verilog as the tool to design a traffic light controller in FPGA (Field Programmable gate array) board.
The FPGA board is connected to the hardware design consisting of lights on a road as of a real world scenario.
When the command prompts for a interval of 10 seconds to each light and a higher time interval to green light for the vehicles to pass.
As per the hardware designed there are 4 lanes of road and prompt is written as per the operation of each road which when passes the vehicles in green light, blocking the vehicles of opposite road in red light.
So, no intersection of vehicles happen avoiding the case of accident in real life scenario.
This model can be implemented in real life in many urban cities which prevents the engaging of traffic officers in on-field work which decreases manpower and inctrease in use of software equipped machinery.
